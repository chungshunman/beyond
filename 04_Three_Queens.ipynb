    "- Three fair coins (Queen/Tails) are tossed at the same time.\n",
    "- Before knowing the outcome of the tossed coins, the player bets an amount of money.\n",
    "- Pay-offs:\n",
    "    - If there are 3 Queens, the pay-off is her bet times 9.\n",
    "    - If there are 2 Queens, the pay-off is her bet times -2.\n",
    "    - If there is 1 Queen, the player loses her bet.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, the player does not lose her bet.\n",
    "- A player starts with 10 CHF in her pocket.\n",
    "- Players always have to bet a positive amount of money.\n",
    "- The game finishes when the player runs out of money or she has bet 10 times.\n",
